This program is a simple casino-style slot machine game built using the pygame library in Python. Players can spin the reels, match symbols, and win coins. The game includes adjustable odds for symbol appearances, win messages, and a jackpot feature.

To play the game, run main.py, and click start on the opening menu. Then, to start the slot machine, click on the lever. 

There are three reels, each with 6 different symbols. The goal is to get three in a row, and if you get there jakpots in a row, the 7 symbol, you get a bonus prize. 

The chance of getting a symbol is random, so you have to keep going until you get a three in a row.

You start with 100 coins, and each spin costs 5. If you get three in a row, you win 10, and if you get a jackpot you get 100. However, these values can be changed to your liking.

If you run out of money, you will be shown a game over sreen, with the option to play again, starting over with 100 coins again.
